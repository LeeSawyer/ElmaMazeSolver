# ElmaMazeSolver

Create a graphic maze, search and solve it using Elma template. Preferable this would be made with a Visual Studeo C++ Form or QT GUI for easy of graphics. Or use graphics liberaries such as Cairomm or Nux as permitted.

Goals would include better appreciation for advanced C++ programming methods/techniques such as classes, inheritance, and State-Machines.





Progress week 8 homework: Making progress with a GUI libreary (https://www.fltk.org/). Not compiling yet, still linking libereary files.

Progress week 9: after adding the included libraries to the g++ compilation, "helloworld" GUI works. But does not work when inside of a docker container.
