# ElmaMazeSolver

Create a graphic maze, search and solve it using Elma template. Preferable this would be made with a Visual Studeo C++ Form for easy of graphics. Or use graphics liberaries such as Cairomm or Nux as permitted.

Goals would include better appreciation for advanced C++ programming methods/techniques such as classes, inheritance, and State-Machines.
